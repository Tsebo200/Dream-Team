## About the Project

### Project Description

Welcome to Dream Team! This is an API generated webpage, it is similar to seeing a forex website/application which displays stats on the currencies, well with that in mind, Dream Team displays players statistics such as their Field Ground points  Except Currencies, something more interesting am I right?...Anyways this website benefits NBA and basketball wannabes to learn more basketball easier with the help of Chart.js to display the content in an interesting manner.

## Features and Functionality

<!-- note how you can use your gitHub link. Just make a path to your assets folder -->




<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly eOpenStacklain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->

## Concept Process

<!-- We really went with a simple and a minimalistic UI design. OpenStack is there to be functional and helpful to any newcomer or veteran of OpenStack. Where they can simply ask, answer and view questions in a quick, concise and effective way. We stick to a simple orange with accents of a baby blue palette, with a light-themed website. A UI trend that really started to rise among web apps, was rounded corners, so we also incorporated that into our design, just to round it off even further. -->

### Wireframes

## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done for the app.

### Implementation Process

<!-- - I used `npx create-react app` to create this React project. I implemented component-based development instead of classes. By doing this, I will be able to easily inject and eject components and sub-components into my project, making it refactorable and reusable instead of writing up classes I have to do everytime making it tedious and redundant

- I implemented to `scss` for the styling of my project and used `module.scss` to style each individual component. An id get given to each classname, making the styling super easy

- I incorporated MongoDB Atlas as my database where I will get and send my data to.

- `axios` was implemented so that I can make HTTP requests to the database server so that I can retrieve, edit, delete and send (CRUD) data to it

- ExpressJS & NodeJS was used so that I can write JavaScript in both my front-end and back-end

- ExpressJS was also used to communicate to my database

- I utilised the `cors` middleware to bypass any errors I will encounter when utilising MongoDB -->

#### Highlights

<!-- stipulated the highlight you eOpenStackerienced with the project -->

<!-- - A very big high point was seeing the data from my backend being populated dynamically in my front-end.
- It was also really amazing to see our site being hosted on Heroku, for the entire digital world to see and interact with
- Fixing all the annoying bugs will always be a plus point
- Handing in the project on time
- Working with deployment software like Heroku -->

#### Challenges

<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->

<!-- - Something we unfortunately could not implement because of time restrictions was Amazon's S3 Bucket's, in the end we had to drop it revert back to Multer for image uploading
- A big challenge was the tag handling in the question's portal, with the help of the team, we were able to get it working
- Getting the emailer to work was also a big pain point, but eventually after a lot of trial-and-error we got it working -->

### Future Implementation

<!-- TODO Change this! -->

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

<!-- - We would like to make this a fully responsive website
- We would like to implement dark mode
- Implement Pagination on Questions Page -->

<!-- MOCKUPS -->

## Final Outcome

### Mockups
